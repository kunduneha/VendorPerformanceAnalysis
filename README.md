# VendorPerformanceAnalysis
**Vendor Performance Analysis**
Data-Driven Insights for Procurement Optimisation & Profitability Enhancement

**Project Overview**
This project delivers a **comprehensive vendor performance evaluation** using transactional sales, purchase, and inventory data to support **strategic procurement decisions, cost optimisation, and profitability improvement**.

**The analysis integrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and business intelligence techniques to identify:**

- Vendor concentration risks
- High-margin but underperforming brands
- Inventory inefficiencies
- Cost advantages of bulk purchasing

The outcomes are designed to be **actionable for procurement managers, finance teams, and senior stakeholders.**

**Business Objectives**
Evaluate vendor contribution to overall sales and profitability
Identify over-dependence on top vendors
Detect low-sales but high-margin brands for growth opportunities
Assess inventory turnover and unsold stock risks
Quantify the financial impact of bulk purchasing strategies

**Datasets Used**
The project uses multiple transactional datasets covering inventory, purchasing, pricing, and sales. 
**Dataset Access (Large Files)**
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the complete raw datasets used in this analysis are hosted externally.

**Analytical Workflow**
**Data Extraction & Cleaning**
- Merged multi-source transactional data
- Handled missing values and data inconsistencies
- Created analytical aggregates at vendor and brand levels

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Distribution analysis of prices, volumes, and sales
- Vendor and brand concentration assessment
- Identification of outliers and skewness patterns

**Vendor Performance Evaluation**
- Sales contribution analysis
- Profit margin computation
- Vendor ranking by revenue and volume

**Statistical Analysis**
- Confidence interval estimation for pricing
- Hypothesis testing to validate bulk purchase cost benefits

**Visualization & Reporting**
- Business-focused plots saved programmatically
- Executive-ready PDF reports generated

**Key Insights**
**Vendor Concentration Risk:**
The top 10 vendors contribute approximately **65.7%** of total sales, indicating significant dependency risk.

**High-Margin, Low-Sales Brands Identified:**
Several brands show strong profit margins but weak sales volumes, representing targeted marketing and distribution opportunities.

**Bulk Purchasing Advantage Confirmed:**
Statistical testing confirms that larger purchase quantities significantly reduce unit costs, supporting volume-based procurement strategies.

**Inventory Inefficiencies Detected:**
High unsold inventory value highlights opportunities for demand forecasting improvement and inventory rationalisation.

**Visualisations Generated**
- Vendor sales contribution charts
- Purchase vs sales price distributions
- Inventory movement analysis
- Profit margin comparisons
- Confidence interval visualisations

**Future Enhancements**
- Vendor risk scoring model
- Time-series demand forecasting
- Automated ETL pipeline
- Power BI / Tableau dashboard integration
- Supplier performance benchmarking framework
